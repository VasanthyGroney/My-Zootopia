## Installation

To install this project, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` using `pip`:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zootopia-api-project.git
cd zootopia-api-project
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the project description for clarity.
2. Fixed the list of dependencies and installation instructions.
3. Ensured consistency in the project naming and repository URL.
4. Removed the redundant mention of `imported: data_fetcher requests os` as this information is typically inferred from the `requirements.txt`.

Example Use Case
A user visits the platform and searches for "penguin." The platform queries the API and returns detailed information about penguins, including their habitat, diet, and unique behaviors. The user can also explore random animal facts, discovering interesting tidbits about creatures they might not have considered before.

This project not only provides educational content but also engages users with the wonders of the animal kingdom in an interactive and informative manner.
